					of any track. These comments are displayed while the associated audio segment is played.
					Users are allowed to create playlists (previously known as "sets"), and to "Like" (specific tracks, which will then be 
					saved to the user's "Like" page), "Repost", "Share", to "Follow" another user, and to make complimentary downloads of their audio available.
					<span class="orange">Sound</span>Cloud's API allows programs to upload music and sound files, or download files if the uploader has gave permission to do so.This API
					has been integrated into several applications, including DAW software such as GarageBand, Logic Pro, and Studio One.</p>
